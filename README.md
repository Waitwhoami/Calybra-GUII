# Calybra-GUI
This Unity project aims to run the known GUI animations present in Calybra devices at runtime.
This means the user can control the animation, as the whole environment is physics interactive.

Important: Once the project is downloaded and opened with any Unity version, you'll be presented with
a blank scene, but all the prefabs will be saved. In the Unity explorer menu, select Scenes and load SampleScene to load
all the objects needed for the Calybra simulation to work.
